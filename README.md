# Online-Arena
Lowell High School's new Online Arena

## Running The Application

Make sure you're in the `online-arena` directory.  Once there, run the following two commands to configure your application correctly:

```
$ bundle install --without production
$ rake setup:dotenv
```

### On Cloud9

If you're using [Cloud9](http://c9.io), run the application with

```
$ ruby online-arena.rb -p $PORT -o $IP
```

### On Your Own Computer

If you're on your own computer, run the application with

```
$ ruby online-arena.rb
```

If everything runs successfully, you should be able to visit <http://localhost:4567> and see the web application.
